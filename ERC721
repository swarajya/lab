Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs/NFTYs/Nifties) are an emerging tool to create provably unique digital assets. Whereas ERC20 ushered in a flood of fungible (where no single token or fraction of a token is unique or distinguishable from any other) tokens, ERC721 and others are allowing for rare and unique units. These units can represent everything from a specific piece of digital artwork (or physical art!) to a real estate asset, financial instrument (a futures contract to buy 1,000 barrels of oil for $60k on December 1), or even a KYC compliance check.
