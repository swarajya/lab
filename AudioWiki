Multitrack recording software now has the capability of creating an unlimited number of tracks, and for each track, you can have numerous channels.

The current standards are:

     Mono(1 channel)
     Stereo(2 channels)
     2.1(3 channels)
     5.1(6 channels)
     7.1(8 channels)

 Note the '.1' refers to a LFE(Low Frequency Effects) Channel. So 5.1 would be 
 5 x Full frequency channels and 1 x Low frequency channel.
