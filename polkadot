Run Step - 1
----------
sudo docker run -p 9944:9944 parity/polkadot:v0.8.24 --name "Local" --rpc-external --ws-external --alice --dev

--name This can be anything, but “Local” will do for now
--ws-external Allow for WebSocket connections
--dev Run the node on “dev mode.” This means that it’s not going to sync with any particular network, but launch a new Polakdot network on your local machine.
--alice Create a small number of wallets with a lot of money! (Alice and Bob are standard names in cryptographic literature).

Step 2
--------
git clone https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps polkadot-js
cd polkadot-js
yarn
yarn run start
