WHERE IS THE BLOCKCHAIN AND EVM DATA STORED?
-------------------------------------------

The directory which Geth uses to store raw blockchain data depends on your operating system. 
Upon running Geth, look for a message that looks like this:

INFO [11-18|14:04:47] Allocated cache and file handles         
database=/Users/bgu/Library/Ethereum/testnet/geth/lightchaindata cache=768 handles=128

The path following “database=” should tell you where the blockchain data is stored on your machine
